# Publishing results based on OpenFisca

OpenFisca is free software made available under the [AGPL license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/). This means that you are free to use, install and modify it, and that you have to contribute your changes back to the community. This is the only way a contributive digital common can be sustainable, so we are very happy that you take part in this shared effort!


## Computation results

If you provide results based on OpenFisca usage, crediting the project would be very welcome in order to increase its visibility and to improve its contributor base. More people means more maintenance and more upgrades!

## Hosting an API instance

If you provide a service that uses OpenFisca, either bundled in a program or serving it over the network, be it directly or wrapped through another API layer, you have to credit OpenFisca, give a link to its source code and license.

The following HTML snippet can be used to credit OpenFisca, for example in your footer or “about” page.
Please make sure to update the destination of the source code link if you use a modified version!

## Distributing changes

If you use and either modify or extend OpenFisca, and that you distribute those changes, you are [legally required](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) to make those changes available to the community. The easiest way to do it is to publish your fork, country package, extension or reform on a source hosting platform such as GitHub, and to [notify](./community.md) the core team of this publication.

Distributing changes means any way of sharing changes to the software with others. Providing software that integrate your changes in any format (source code, package, etc.) is considered as distribution, which means you also have to make your changes available.

Please also note that, under AGPL provisions, serving over the network is considered as distribution, which means you also have to make your changes available, even if you don't keep the running instance on your servers.

Finally note that it isn't required that the source code of the software integrating your changes be published.
